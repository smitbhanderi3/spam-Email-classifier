Certainly! Below is a template for a GitHub README for a Spam Email Classifier using Streamlit:

**Spam Email Classifier with Streamlit** <br>
**Overview** <br>
This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using machine learning and a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit. The classifier is trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails, providing a convenient tool for users to identify and filter out unwanted messages.<br>

**Features**<br>
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained model to classify emails as spam or not spam.<br>

Streamlit Interface: Offers an intuitive and interactive user interface through Streamlit.<br>

Accuracy: Aims for high accuracy in spam detection.<br>

**How It Works**<br>
The system uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled emails. The model has learned patterns and features indicative of spam, enabling it to make predictions on new email inputs. The Streamlit interface provides users with an easy way to interact with the classifier and obtain predictions for their emails.<br>


**Configuration**<br>
You may need to customize certain parameters, such as the model used, dataset, or any other configuration. Refer to the config.yaml file for easy adjustments.<br>
